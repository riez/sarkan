Design used on above screen are based on a few concern:
1. Make it simple for user to immediately search by Using the searchbox beside the Filter Button.
2. When the user want to have more options. They can have it by clicking Filter Button which give them option to use Advance Search.

## Admin - New Data

By using centered view hopefully make the user more focus. We also need to give them options for the fields that has standard value like area and size so it will prevent the user to type/fill wrong value.

## User - Homepage

As brand, we always want to have a good impression when user first visit the website. Usually in the landing page the user will be given promo/best deal or items that they are looking for to prevent bounce.
Search widget placed in the top of website because we want to make sure that the user will have an easy experience to find data on our website.

## User - List

In the list page we still (ofc, we must) retain the search widget. The reason is same like i said before (ez to find = more interaction = more chance to convert).
